    <h1> from nothing to something</h1>
    <p> Josh Allen's journey from a no-star recruit to an NFL MVP candidate is a testament to his work ethic, resilience, and undeniable talent. Coming out of high school, Allen was largely overlooked by major college programs, largely due to a lack of attention from scouts and a perceived rawness in his game. However, his determination and development at the University of Wyoming allowed him to prove his worth, showcasing a cannon of an arm, impressive athleticism, and the ability to make jaw-dropping plays. Despite his unrefined skills early on, Allen's potential was undeniable, earning him a spot in the NFL as a first-round pick. Fast forward to his time with the Buffalo Bills, and Allen transformed into one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the league. His growth as both a passer and leader has been remarkable, culminating in MVP-caliber seasons. Allen’s story is a powerful reminder that hard work, persistence, and belief in one’s own abilities can turn an underdog story into a shining success.</p>

  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.
